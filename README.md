# E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis

This project analyzes historical sales data from an e-commerce platform to answer key business questions related to monthly performance, top-selling products, and frequently bought-together items.

## Dataset
- Feather file: `Sales_data.ftr` (pre-cleaned dataset)

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Objectives
- Identify the best month for sales
- Find top-selling products and understand why
- Analyze product pricing vs. order volume
- Discover product combinations frequently bought together

## Key Insights
- **December** generated the highest sales — likely due to holiday shopping.
- **AAA Batteries** were the top-selling product, due to their low price and high utility.
- There's a **negative correlation** between product price and order quantity: cheaper products are bought more.
- Frequently bought combinations (e.g., “Google Phone + USB-C Cable”) show potential for bundling and cross-sell strategies.

## How to Run
1. Place `Sales_data.ftr` in your working directory
2. Open and run `Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`
